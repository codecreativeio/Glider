# Glider

ðŸ”´ This project is not ready for production use

A ServiceNow Scoped Application that exposes an API for building encoded queries and GlideRecord objects. While this library has a similar goal to the original [GliderJS API](https://codecreative.io/blog/lodash-style-interface-for-gliderecord/), it does not share any of the original code base and is completely revamped.
